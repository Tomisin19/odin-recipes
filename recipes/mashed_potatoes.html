    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Mashed potatoes are the ultimate comfort food â€” creamy, buttery, and irresistibly smooth. 
        Made by boiling peeled potatoes until tender and then mashing them with a blend of butter, milk (or cream), 
        and a touch of salt, this dish delivers a rich and fluffy texture that melts in your mouth.
    </p>

    <p>
        Perfect as a side dish, mashed potatoes pair beautifully with everything from roasted meats and stews to 
        vegetables and gravies. Whether you like them silky smooth or slightly chunky, with garlic, cheese, or herbs,
         mashed potatoes are a timeless, hearty classic that brings warmth to any meal.
